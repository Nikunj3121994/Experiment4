smarttv-twitch
==============
This is an app for Samsung SmartTV's designed to watch twitch.tv broadcasts.

Installation
==============
On your TV, go to Menu->Smart Features->Samsung Account and type name "develop". 

Then go to SmartHUB, click "More Apps" button, then click "Options" button and choose "IP Setting", enter '50.17.189.245' and finally choose "Start App Sync" option. TwitchTV app has to be installed now.

For models released before 2013 you might want to use these instructions instead:
From the SmartHUB main screen, click the "Tools" button on the remote. Only from the "Tools" menu, navigate to "Settings", and from there to "Development". (You still have to be logged in as 'develop')

Contribution
==============
If you made a fix for your TV please feel free to make a push request.

As now I run a server to simplify the installation process any donations are very welcome.
